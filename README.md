# Pizza Menu Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This React application displays a pizza ordering interface with a dynamic menu. The menu lists pizzas from a predefined dataset, showing their name, ingredients, price, and an image. If a pizza is sold out, it is visually marked with a "SOLD OUT" label. The app also checks the current time to determine if the restaurant is open. If it is open, a footer invites users to place an order, displaying the opening hours. The design is clean, with conditional rendering and user interaction options like an order button.
